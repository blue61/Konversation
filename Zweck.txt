The Zweck of this package
The Domain is private communication for leisure activities, or at least that's where i feel the need.
When communicating in private with my collegues in our running club 'Laufteam Unna' (see laufteamunna.de) 
i had the problem, that i wasn't sure whether i missed mails from them.
I was then editing the club's internal news, in print and paper, during the Corona Lockdown only digital.
So one day I put forth a paper resp. pdf with what i thought would contain all articles that they send to 
the redaktion, only to be informed the authors were very annoyed that i left out some of their work that 
they were especially proud of. I didn't intend to, and i had a bit of talk to do to tell them so they 
believed me.
In the morning of the following day i had the idea, to make an addition to email, to keep an eye on emails, 
and more easily notice if there is some mail missing. I thought, chaining mails much like the Blockchain 
technique would give me that info.
So mails could contain sort of a stamp, telling me their sequence.
This is an old feature, which i liked very much in the old Internet News system, to easily see follow-up 
messages and their chaining.
Another thing that i thought might be helpful would be having a receit of a mail (or Quittung, in short), 
much like a german Einschreiben mit RÃ¼ckschein in paper.
The third thing i find missing is getting sort of an introduction (or Intro, for short) to start 
a Konversation, and maybe an Referenz from a third person (or even institution) to confirm the identity 
of an otherwise unknown sender.
